**Tasty is a delicious theme for Wordpress** that comes in five different colors. With *SocialGrid* you can easily add Twitter, Facebook, and more to your site.

It used to cost $$$, now it's FREE for everyone! Woot!


### For the Impatient

[Download Here (zip)](https://github.com/whalesalad/tasty/zipball/master) and drop it into your `/wp-content/themes` directory.

If you run into problems, tweet me [@whalesalad](http://twitter.com/whalesalad)


### Some Features

* **Five Colors** - Pink, Green, Orange, Purple, and Blue are all part of the Tasty theme. Change colors at the click of a button.
* **Easily Customizable** - Sidebar on the left or right? Custom header image? Search in the header or in the sidebar? The choice is yours.
* **SocialGrid** - Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and more at your fingertips. Enter your usernames and the grid appears automatically.
* **Fast &amp; Clean Code** - This used to be true. Now I look at the code and I want to vomit. Times change!


### Requirements

* **Tasty is a theme for self-hosted versions of WordPress.** If you are using the **dot-com** free version of WordPress, Tasty will not work for you.
* **Tasty requires PHP 5, and will not work with PHP 4.** Most web hosts give you the ability to choose the version of PHP you would like to use in your admin panel, make sure to select PHP 5.
**Tasty requires WordPress 2.7 or higher.** There really is no reason why you shouldn't be running the latest and most secure version of WordPress, and Tasty isn't tested on anything else.</li>


### Changelog

Below is the official changelog of releases and what went into them.

#### 3/16/2010 - Version 1.4
* Added a new feature, you can now choose your own background color using a slick color picker inside of the admin!
* Fixed an issue with the search box not working on pages other than the homepage.
* Added a PHP5 version check to prevent new users on PHP4 from feeling like dweebs when their settings don't save. Borrowed from SocialGrid 2.0.

#### 11/29/2009 - Version 1.3
* Improved pagination, borrowed from Elixir 2.0
* Improved (experimental) the titles of blog post headers, shrinks text based upon length of title
* Minor SocialGrid tweaks to animation and links now open in a new window (thanks @marrsattacks)
* Fixed the broken comments link that has plagued this release for a while =(

#### 08/17/2009 - Version 1.2
* Fixed issues with image links having borders
* Fixed an issue where if you disabled the header text in the Tasty settings area, the search box would get disabled as well.
* Fixed an issue regarding jQuery having problems with other frameworks. Rewritten in a "framework independant" mode where things like Prototype will no longer interfere and break functionality (liek the SocialGrid)
* Fixed an issue where comment links were not working in the search and archive pages. Globalized the loop in /lib/template/loop.php
* Removed the PSD's from the theme download (so you can upload a .zip file directly to your WP install), they are now accessable from the readme. This also makes the download smaller!
* Special thanks to Michael Kaiser for finding and sharing most of these problems.

#### 07/10/2009 - Version 1.1
* Theme now works in sub-directories.
* Added admin option to disable search component inside of header.
* Minor code cleanup here and there, naturally.

#### 07/04/2009 - Version 1.0
* Initial release! Yippee!
