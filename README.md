**Tasty is a delicious theme for Wordpress** that comes in five different colors. With *SocialGrid* you can easily add Twitter, Facebook, and more to your site.

It used to cost $$$, now it's FREE for everyone! Woot!

### Some Features

* **Five Colors** - Pink, Green, Orange, Purple, and Blue are all part of the Tasty theme. Change colors at the click of a button.
* **Easily Customizable** - Sidebar on the left or right? Custom header image? Search in the header or in the sidebar? The choice is yours.
* **SocialGrid** - Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and more at your fingertips. Enter your usernames and the grid appears automatically.
* **Fast &amp; Clean Code** - This used to be true. Now I look at the code and I want to vomit. Times change!

### Requirements

* **Tasty is a theme for self-hosted versions of WordPress.** If you are using the **dot-com** free version of WordPress, Tasty will not work for you.
* **Tasty requires PHP 5, and will not work with PHP 4.** Most web hosts give you the ability to choose the version of PHP you would like to use in your admin panel, make sure to select PHP 5.
**Tasty requires WordPress 2.7 or higher.** There really is no reason why you shouldn't be running the latest and most secure version of WordPress, and Tasty isn't tested on anything else.</li>
