*** Tasty Changelog - http://whalesalad.com/tasty ***

11/29/2009 - Version 1.3
  * Improved pagination, borrowed from Elixir 2.0
  * Improved (experimental) the titles of blog post headers, shrinks text based upon length of title
  * Minor SocialGrid tweaks to animation and links now open in a new window (thanks @marrsattacks)
  * Fixed the broken comments link that has plagued this release for a while =(

08/17/2009 - Version 1.2
  * Fixed issues with image links having borders
  * Fixed an issue where if you disabled the header text in the Tasty settings area, the search box would get disabled as well.
  * Fixed an issue regarding jQuery having problems with other frameworks. Rewritten in a "framework independant" mode where things like Prototype will no longer interfere and break functionality (liek the SocialGrid)
  * Fixed an issue where comment links were not working in the search and archive pages. Globalized the loop in /lib/template/loop.php
  * Removed the PSD's from the theme download (so you can upload a .zip file directly to your WP install), they are now accessable from the readme. This also makes the download smaller!
  * Special thanks to Michael Kaiser for finding and sharing most of these problems.

07/10/2009 - Version 1.1
  * Theme now works in sub-directories.
  * Added admin option to disable search component inside of header.
  * Minor code cleanup here and there, naturally.

07/04/2009 - Version 1.0
